PURPOSES OF EACH PIECES

Tank blocks the bullet from going further.

Titan is like a king of chess, inorder to win the game make sure the bullet hits the enemy titan

Cannon shoots a bullet after each and every move. Remember the cannon does not shoot a bullet when the cannon is moved to a new grid. After the placement it is allowed to shoot in the next turn.

Ricochets have two reflecting surfaces. On each move either you can rotate the ricochets or move it in another grid. The purpose of the ricochet is to reflect the bullet by 90 degrees to the reflecting side.

Semi ricochet also have the same purpose as that of the ricochet, the only difference is it has only one reflecting surface.
